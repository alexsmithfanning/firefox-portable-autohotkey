# Firefox Portable launcher written in AutoHotkey
A much less bloated version of PortableApps.com's portable Firefox launcher.

* Supports backing up of your profile, data, and other settings.
* Doesn't need user intervention to update.
* Hopefully more soon!

## Setting download URL and download mode
### Fast download mode
The `FastDownloadMode` variable sets whether to use the current computer's temporary directory or to use the default (usually much slower) download directory.

### Download URL
By default the download URL is Mozilla's latest Firefox Beta Channel link. You can use any download URL as long as its an offline installer. I've put together some of the most used URLs below in a nice table:

Firefox Edition | URL
-----------------|------------------
Firefox Stable | https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-42.0-SSL&os=win64&lang=en-US
Firefox Beta | https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-43.0b9-SSL&os=win64&lang=en-US
Firefox Devloper Edition | https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-aurora-latest-ssl&os=win64&lang=en-US
