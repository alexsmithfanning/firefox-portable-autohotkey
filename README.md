# Firefox Portable launcher written in AutoHotkey
A much less bloated version of PortableApps.com's portable Firefox launcher.

* Supports backing up of your profile, data, and other settings.
* Doesn't need user intervention to update.
* Hopefully more soon!

**The README.md is not yet finished, mind you!**
